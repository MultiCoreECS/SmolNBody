# SmolNBody

This experiment runs a simple N-body simulation for 100,000 iterations. Each body is given a random position within a 10x10 square box and a random mass between 1 and 5.

To run the simulation enter this command at the command line:

		~$ cargo run --count <integer>
    
In the <integer> field, enter any positive number to represent the amount of bodies that will be simulated by the experiment.
